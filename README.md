# Behavioural-Cloning
This repository contains the code written using Keras using Tensorflow as backend for Behavioural Cloning research paper by NVidia AI Research 

## Running the Code

- python bc.py runs the model and weights are saved in .h5 file
- utils.py is generating batches for training images
- rospub.py is for sending steering angle to the Robot over same network in which PC as Master and Robot as Slave
- data folder contains the images for training and shortly I will upload code for saving images with steering angles i.e.., Dataset preparation
